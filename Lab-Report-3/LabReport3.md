# Lab Report 3
---
- For this lab, I will be focusing on the `less` command
---
4 interesting command-line options I will be using are:

- `-N`
- `-s`

These two options I found from this website --> [How to Use the less Command in Linux with Examples](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/less-command-in-linux#:~:text=Note%3A%20By%20default%2C%20searching%20in,phrase%20and%20see%20the%20results)

- `-F`
- `-g`

These two options I found from this website --> [less(1) â€” Linux manual page]([http://a.com](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html))
